To ensure code maintainability and global standards, the following rules must be followed:

1. **Code Naming**: All variables, functions, classes, and properties must be named exclusively in English (e.g., use `priceValue` instead of `valorPrecio`).
2. **Comments**: All source code comments must be written in English.
3. **Internal Documentation**: Any internal logs or documentation added to the codebase must be in English.
4. **Localization Keys**: String resource keys (IDs in `strings.xml`) must be in English.
5. **Chat Communication**: Despite the code being in English, chat communication with the USER will continue in the USER's original language (e.g., Spanish) to ensure clear collaboration.
