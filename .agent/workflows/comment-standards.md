description: Code Commenting Standards
---
To maintain a professional and clean codebase, all comments must adhere to the following rules:

1. **Necessity**: Only include comments that are strictly necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious architectural decisions. Avoid stating the obvious.
2. **Objective Content**: Comments must refer exclusively to the code's functionality, logic, or structure.
3. **No Personal Communication**: Never include comments directed at the USER (e.g., avoid "I added this because you asked" or "Reminder: update this"). Any communication with the USER must happen through the chat, not the source code.
4. **Professional Tone**: Maintain a formal and objective tone, following industry best practices for high-quality software.
5. **Language**: In accordance with the development standard, all comments must be written in English.
6. **Respect Existing Comments**: During modifications, only remove comments that are strictly redundant. Do not remove or modify existing comments if the corresponding code has not been changed, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
